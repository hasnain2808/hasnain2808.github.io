						<h3>Emotionally Intelligent Virtual AI Companion</h3>
						<h4>Jun 2019 – Present</h4>
						<p align='justify'>
							<ul>
								<li>The mental health issues of loneliness and depression are two rapidly growing
									problems
									in society today.The feeling of being alone is often noted to be an ironic feeling
									given
									the
									almost invasive nature of social networking and mobile platforms today.
								<li>There is an
									ever-increasing demand for solutions to help people suffering from these mental
									health
									issues.
									According to government statistics, India needs 13,500 psychiatrists in the country
									and the
									nation has only 3,827. Where the country desperately needs 20,250 clinical
									psychologists, we
									have only 898. There is also sadly a stigma attached to these problems as Indian
									society
									generally looks at people with these problems in a very negative light and outcasts
									them.
								<li>Many
									Indians who suffer from these problems find seeking help shameful and avoidable,
									which is
									detrimental to their healing. Therefore, human solutions are grossly inadequate at
									present.
								<li>Artificial Intelligence is a fast-growing phenomenon that has captured the interest
									of
									experts
									from many different fields of study as a way of facilitating complex problem-solving
									in a
									way
									that was not previously possible.
								<li>This solution aims to create artificial intelligence that
									simulates a lot of the human processes of communication such as establishing
									long-term
									relationships with the user, understanding the mood of the user during a
									conversation and
									also
									detecting whether a user is depressed or lonely.
								<li>The system does not act as a therapist or a
									counselor but rather attempts to present itself as a “companion” that can offer the
									user
									tools
									such as meditation to manage their feelings and emotion.
							</ul>

						<h3>Chart Analytics</h3>
						<h4>June 2019 – Nov 2019</h4>
						<p align='justify'>
							<li>Trained a custom CNN for classification of the chart</li>
							<li>
								Extracted Charts such as Bar Chart with their labels from FigureQa Dataset
							</li>
							<li>
								Using Image Processing techniques to extract numerical information from the charts
							</li>
						</p>

						<h3>Cyberbot</h3>
						<h4>Aug 2019–Oct 2019</h4>
						<p align='justify'>
							<li>A bot that answers Natural Language queries for a specific vulnerability given by user
							</li>
							<li>
								Wrote code that does transfer learning on Bert for the Question Answering
							</li>
							<li>
								Coded a finite state machine in python to manage states
							</li>
						</p>

						<h3>Pheme –Ai-Qa News Bot (Winner Unscript’19 Hackathon</h3>
						<h4>Mar 2019</h4>
						<p align='justify'>
							<li>Pull news from various sources</li>
							<li>
								Stage them at a central server</li>
							<li>
								Check if the news is true/false</li>
							<li>
								Classify according to categories</li>
							<li>
								Deliver to the end user according to requirements</li>
						</p>
						<h3>SERVER LOG MANAGEMENT
						</h3>
						<h4>Feb 2019 – Mar 2019</h4>
						<p align='justify'>
							<li>Smart India Hackathon Finalist
							</li>
							<li>
								The solution would collect logs from various sources and store it in a central location
							</li>
							<li>
								Analyze the logs to detect errors or anomalies
							</li>
							<li>
								Create dashboards for analysis
							</li>
							<li>
								Categorize the errors and anomalies according to severity.
							</li>
							<li>
								Search various Search engines and OEM sites for solutions to the errors/ anomalies and
								display them interactively.
							</li>
							<li>
								Used Elastic stack for data engineering
							</li>
							<li>
								Python for machine learning and website backend HTML/CSS, javascript for frontend.
							</li>
							<li>
								Role: Leader of the team
							</li>
						</p>
						<h3>SMART HOME AUTOMATION USING IMAGE PROCESSING</h3>
						<h4>Jul 2018 – Oct 2018</h4>
						<p align='justify'>The objective of this project is to develop a smart IoT based light control
							system. <li>Due to negligence and forgetfulness, many instances occur in establishments
								where
								the electrical appliances are left turned on even if there no human presence in a room.
								This
								is one of the most prominent cases of electricity wastage prevalent in society.
							<li> Hence
								there
								is a need for an intelligent system that can ensure both efficiency and effectiveness.
							<li>This
								project combines IoT, Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing which are powerful
								modern
								technologies. In this system, object detection methods are used which enable us to
								control
								appliances in a specific spatial region.
							<li>It also uses image processing methods which
								are
								more efficient than conventional IR blaster-based home automation systems.
							<li> This
								project proposes a system which can efficiently utilize the lighting
								output and minimize the wastage of electricity by controlling the electrical appliances
								by
								detecting changes in the position of the humans in the room.
						</p>
						<h3>HAND SIGN DETECTION</h3>
						<h4>Apr 2018 – May 2018</h4>
						<p align='justify'>Hand sign image recognition using resnet50 model
							using keras with tensorflow backend</p>
						<h3>DINOSAUR NAME GENERATION</h3>
						<h4>Mar 2018 – Apr 2018</h4>
						<p align='justify'>Generate dinosaur names using Character level modelling using Numpy pandas
							from scratch</p>
