						<h3>Virtual AI Companion Using graphs / MYK 

						</h3>
						<!-- <h5>Jun 2019 – Present</h5> -->
						<b>
							<p align='justify'>
								<ul>
									<li>A companion that could establish long term relationships with the user.</li>
									<li>Graph is used as the memory to store context for the chit-chat model and graph embeddings are used for the factual question answering</li>
									<li>A lstm classifier is built to classify intent to factual and chit-chat </li>
									<li>The input is processed using Stanford Core NLP for triplet extraction and coreference analysis and Spacy pipelines for other tasks such as tokenization, lemmatization, stemming, etc. The chit-chat model is trained using OpenAI gpt2 and using persona chat data. Our model ranks second on one metric and third on two other metrics. </li>
									<li>The final product can be used at various locations such as customer service, sales and healthcare. The notable benefit being long term relationships </li>

						<h3>Virtual AI Companion Using Mayer’s Briggs </h3>
						<!-- <h5>Jun 2019 – Present</h5> -->
						<b>
							<p align='justify'>
								<ul>
									<li>This system uses personality predicted by MBT using xgboost instead of
										personality from persona chat dataset for giving a personality to the bot </li>
									<li>the objective can be achieved by dividing the system into four parts - 1) The
										input processor, 2) The personality detection subsystem, 3) The response
										generation, 4) The output generator</li>
									<li>Each input from the user would be first go through basic preprocessing such as
										tokenization and converted to embeddings in the input processor. The input
										processor would store the input to list of utterances. If the user sends the
										input as speech signals, the speech would be converted into text and the other
										steps remain the same</li>
									<li>The personality detection subsystem would consist of a text classifier. The text
										classifier would classify the text into various personalities using the Mayer's
										Briggs [add a short description on what Mayer's Briggs is] The tokenized input
										from the input processor would be fed to a Machine Learning model.</li>
									<li>The response generation: This would use the personality detected by the
										personality detector and prepend it to the list of utterances. This list of
										utterances would be fed to a Deep Learning based response generation model, that
										generates a stream of token to be processed by the output generator.</li>
									<li>The output processor converts the tokens to English words. These words are
										displayed in the chat window</li>

						<h3>SMART HOME AUTOMATION USING IMAGE PROCESSING</h3>
						<h5>Jul 2018 – Oct 2018</h5>
						<p align='justify'>The objective of this project is to develop a smart IoT based light control
							system. <li>Due to negligence and forgetfulness, many instances occur in establishments
								where
								the electrical appliances are left turned on even if there no human presence in a room.
								This
								is one of the most prominent cases of electricity wastage prevalent in society.
							<li> Hence
								there
								is a need for an intelligent system that can ensure both efficiency and effectiveness.
							<li>This
								project combines IoT, Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing which are powerful
								modern
								technologies. In this system, object detection methods are used which enable us to
								control
								appliances in a specific spatial region.
							<li>It also uses image processing methods which
								are
								more efficient than conventional IR blaster-based home automation systems.
							<li> This
								project proposes a system which can efficiently utilize the lighting
								output and minimize the wastage of electricity by controlling the electrical appliances
								by
								detecting changes in the position of the humans in the room.
