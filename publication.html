							Smart Home Automation using Computer Vision and Segmented Image
							Processing
						</h4>
						<h5>Apr 5, 2019</h5>
						<h5>
							IEEE 8th International Conference on Communication and Signal
							Processing
						</h5>
						<p align="justify">
							The objective of this paper is to develop a smart IoT based
							light control system. Due to negligence and forgetfulness, many
							instances occur in establishments where the electrical
							appliances are left turned on even if there no human presence in
							a room. This is one of the most prominent cases of electricity
							wastage prevalent in society. Hence there is a need for an
							intelligent system that can ensure both efficiency and
							effectiveness. This project combines IoT, Artificial
							Intelligence and Image Processing which are powerful modern
							technologies. In this system, object detection methods are used
							which enable us to control appliances in a specific spatial
							region. It also uses image processing methods which are more
							efficient than conventional IR blaster-based home automation
							systems. conventional IR blasters inevitably come with a fallacy
							where any and all objects that obstruct the infrared ray trigger
							whatever response the system was programmed to achieve. These
							actions that are only meant for actual human beings can now be
							activated by any object. This produces an undesired result. This
							paper proposes a system which can efficiently utilize the
							lighting output and minimize the wastage of electricity by
							controlling the electrical appliances by detecting changes in
							the position of the humans in the room.

						Artificial General Intelligence has been the main aim of
						artificial intelligence right from its inception. Creating an
						intelligence that is capable of performing tasks with at least a
						human-level of intelligence has driven a lot of the innovation
						in this domain and the fruits of these decades of research and
						application have led to the immense popularity of artificial
						intelligence and its sub-domains in todayâ€™s world. The review
						paper provides a review of several tools and techniques from
						various attempts to create artificial general intelligence in
						the last two decades.

						<h4>
							Energy-efficient face recognition authentication system using
							human detection IoT modules (preprint)
						</h4>
						<p align="justify">
							The application of effective techniques like facial recognition
							and object detection in the domain of IoT has revolutionized the
							levels of control and accuracy sensors have had for a variety of
							purposes. Face recognition modules have established their
							immense usefulness, and their impact has overweighed most other
							traditional forms of access control. It remains one of the most
							secure methods to authenticate human beings to grant them access
							to restricted areas or systems in an organization. However, this
							incomparable rise in accuracy comes with a relatively huge
							price. The algorithms used in facial recognition are complex
							mathematical functions that are iteratively performed on vast
							volumes of data continuously. In IoT applications, the embedded
							systems that run these algorithms are at all times clocked to
							their maximum processing power, they need not run in cases when
							there are no humans are present in the vicinity. This is
							inefficient, especially in systems that need to perform face
							recognition round-the-clock for authentication. This paper
							proposes a simple, intuitive and efficient solution to conserve
							the processor from being clocked to its maximum throughput
							without compromising on the high level of security that the face
							recognition algorithm offers.
