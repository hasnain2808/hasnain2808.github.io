				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p align='justify'>
					<ul>
						<li>I am pursuing engineering from Mumbai University.
						<li> During my studies I have taken various courses from my University including computer
							science
							courses, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics
						<li>Mathematics courses include courses such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability,
							Statistics and Discrete Mathematics
						<li> Computer Science courses include basic courses such as Programming, OOPM, Java, Python,
							Data Structures,
							Algorithms, OS, Networking, Databases etc
						<li> Advanced courses include Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, Data Warehousing, Cloud
							computing, IOT, Soft Computing etc.
						<li>With courses from my School I have undertaken various online courses and Nanodegrees such as
							Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree, Coursera Machine Learning by Stanford University, Deep
							Learning.ai specialization, python and Image Processing courses (More on this in the
							certificaction page).
						<li> I have also worked on various projects including Conversational bots, Home automation using
							Computer Vision, etc (More on this in the
							projects page).
						<li>I have worked on various languages and technologies such as
							Python, Django, flask, databases, NLP, NLU, Image processing, cloud, machine learning/
							Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, data structures, algorithms, TensorFlow, Pytorch,
							Keras, etc.
						<li>It’s been almost 2-3 years now and there's not even a single day I have not
							learned, applied or taught ML/DL/DS or related fields.
						<li>I am a strong believer that
							technologies evolve and change every now and then, so I make sure that I understand the
							inherent purpose of using a command, framework, language or tool rather than just learning
							the syntax and applying.

				<h3>Interests</h3>
				<p align='justify'>


					<ul>
						<li>AI had redefine how we live our lives
						<li>AI coupled with good software engineering skills can have an impact that the world has never
							witnessed
						<li>My core interests lie in combining by Software engineering skills such as Data structures,
							algorithms, Databases, System Design, etc with my Ai skills to work towards achieving goals
							in:
							<ul>
								<li>NLP, NLU, Machine Translation
								<li>Self driving cars which includes not just computer vision but also all the other
									parts of AI such as Planning Searching
								<li>Conversational agents
								<li>Medical and healthcare
								<li>psychiatry and psychology
								<li>Graph Databases and Graph Neural Networks
							</ul>
						<li>I am working towards creating platforms for social good
					</ul>

					There are various applications of NLP that define how we
					communicate with the machines as well as others where the machine acts as an
					intermediator. Initial works towards making machines understand what humans want them to
					do were in the field of formal languages which included FA, PDA, Turing machines. We have
					come a long way since then, now we can express in Natural Language and the machine
					does the tasks that we want them to do. NLP has revolutionized how we live our day to day
					lives. Conversational agents that use short term memory include bots that can carry out
					simple tasks such as setting TODO, finance or healthcare support bots. Conversational
					agents that include long term memory can form long term relationships with users with
					humans can be used to help humans with issues such as depression, loneliness.<br />
					My central goal is to do some significant contributions to artificial intelligence as a
					whole and
					not just Machine Learning. This goal I am trying to achieve through two ways viz,
					Self-driving
					cars and Conversational Agents. Self-driving is a domain that currently uses AI as a whole
					which included Search, Planning, Perception, Motion, and execution and not just Machine
					Learning so I am highly interested in this domain and would love to contribute as much as
					possible.
					NLP has the power to redefine how we communicate with machines. This can be used to
					become more customer-centric by providing them agents to help even when human agents
					are filled with calls. Today customers prefer talking to a human agent but I believe once we
					achieve a level in NLP where our AI agents can talk like humans, customers wouldn’t have
					any preference. This analogous to the travelers preferring autopilot over human pilots in
					airplanes, because the autopilot is much more error-free and accurate.
					Uber has been at the forefront of AI research with innovation at each level. Be it computer
					vision or NLP. -->

				<h3>What I've been upto lately</h3>
				<p align='justify'>
					<li>I completed an internship at Ugam as a consultant-ERM in data science and another at
						Network Intelligence in role of an intern for Python/Django. </li>
					<li>I recently participated in two hackathons with my colleagues acting as a
						leader in both of them. We won one of them (unscript'19) and were the finalists in the
						smart
						India Hackathon 2019. </li>
					<li>I wrote my first research paper wherein I used segmented human
						detection using object detection to control home applications. </li>
					<li> Currently, I am working on my
						engineering dissertation. This includes applying theories from psychology, psychiatry,
						AI,
						NLP, CV to create a companion that could establish long term relationships with the
						user.</li>
					<li> A
						few days back I graduated from Udacity computer vision nanodegree and I am working
						towards the self-driving specialization on Coursera.</li>
                                        <li>I contributed twice on the python pandas library recently for beginner issues</li>
